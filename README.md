# Person-Of-Interest-identifier-Enron-company-
In this project I will build a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. I use email and financial data for 146 executives at Enron to identify persons of interest in the fraud case. A person of interest (POI) is someone who was indicted for fraud, settled with the government, or testified in exchange for immunity. This report documents the machine learning techniques used in building a POI identifier.
