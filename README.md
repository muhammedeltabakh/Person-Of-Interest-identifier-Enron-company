# Person-Of-Interest-identifier-Enron-company-
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.


In this project I will build a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. I use email and financial data for 146 executives at Enron to identify persons of interest in the fraud case. A person of interest (POI) is someone who was indicted for fraud, settled with the government, or testified in exchange for immunity. This report documents the machine learning techniques used in building a POI identifier.

There are four major steps in my project:

Enron dataset
Feature processing
Algorithm
Validation
